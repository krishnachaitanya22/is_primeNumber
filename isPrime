#finding prime number
''' in first step defining the function called  "is_prime" 
 and in indention of function taking input from the user using keyword 'input()' &
  assigning value to the variable n 
  after that writing logic of whether the number prime or not
  logic: if the number is divisible by it self it is prime number else it is not a prime number'''

#defining the function 
def is_prime():    
  n=int(input())    #taking input from the user
  if n >1:
    for i in range(2,n):
      if n%i==0:
        print(f'{n} is not a prime number')
        break
    else:
      print(f'{n} is a prime number')
      
#calling  function by function name
